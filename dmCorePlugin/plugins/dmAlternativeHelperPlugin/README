dmAlternativeHelperPlugin
=================

The dmAlternativeHelperPlugin provides Diem's helper functions (Diem's class-based and symfony's standard function-based helpers) that normally require the pound sign (i.e. £, £link, £o etc.) but for people without this letter on their keyboards to ease template development.

Available helpers are:

  * _tag (= £)
  * _tagO (= £o)
  * _tagC (= £c)
  * _link (= £link)
  * _media (= £media)
  * _table (= £table)

The plugin is fully extensible. Only works with Diem 5.0 installed.
